Find and fix errors in your designs with Figma Co-pilot , a plugin for Figma which help in following proper Design Guidelines to carve a better UI. 

Figma Co-pilot finds guideline erros within your designs on all your layers. Ensure your designs are ready for development or design collaboration by fixing inconsistencies.

While it's running, Figma Co-pilot will update automatically as you fix errors. Clicking on layer will also select that layer in your design. Navigating between each error is fast and much easier than trying to find errors on your own.

## What does Figma Co-pilot check for by default?
Out of the box, Figma Co-pilot only checks for guideline and layout erros in each layer. In Figma, the best practice is to use styles and proper naming (also referred to as design tokens) on all of your layers, so your type, colors, spacing etc are all consistent and it will help the developer easily identify the elements and components.

That being said, Figma Co-pilot is ready for you to write custom rules for your team. For example, if you wanted to ensure that no text layers are using background specific colors, you can check out the example is provided below.
